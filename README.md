# Tech Talent Skill Gap Analysis
This repository provides a detailed analysis of tech talent preferences and skill gaps across programming languages, databases, and tech roles. The goal of this project is to uncover actionable insights into industry trends and highlight areas where the supply of skilled professionals falls short of demand.

# Project Objectives
Understand the technologies (languages and databases) that tech talent aspire to work with.

Identify countries with the largest skill gaps for programming languages and databases.

Highlight the most desired programming language among tech professionals.

Analyze tech roles with the highest skill mismatches between demand and supply.

# Key Insights
Languages and Databases Tech Talent Want to Work With a detailed breakdown of preferred programming languages and databases based on survey data.

Countries with the Highest Skill Gaps: Analysis of regional disparities in skill availability for key technologies.

Most Wanted Language: Identification of the programming language most sought after by professionals.

Tech Roles with the Highest Skill Gaps: A focus on roles experiencing the most significant skill shortages.

# Data and Methodology
Dataset: Data was collected through surveys targeting tech professionals and organizations.

Analysis:

Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.

Visualizations to present findings in an accessible and impactful way.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

# Repository Structure
data/: Contains raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis.

visualizations/: Charts and graphs illustrating key findings.

reports/: Summary reports and actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

README.md: Overview of the project.

# Findings and Recommendations
The skill gap for specific programming languages and databases is most pronounced in certain regions.

Organizations need to focus on upskilling initiatives tailored to address these shortages.

Educational institutions and training programs should align their curriculum with the most wanted skills and technologies.
